THEORY:
-Nested Order and Unorder List:-
    A nested list in HTML is a list within a list. Nested lists in HTML are quite useful and are frequently used as the foundation for navigation menus since they determine the website's hierarchical structure. We can make a nested unordered list, a nested ordered list, or even an ordered list nested inside an unordered list.
    In HTML documents, we will utilise either the HTML \<ul> or HTML \<ol> elements to construct a nested list. The first element refers to an unordered list, while the second element is used to produce an ordered list.
    However, neither of these two ways produces a completely working list without the HTML \<li> element. This tag is used to not only list all of the products we'll need but also to create nested ordered and unordered lists.

-Semantics Tags for the Layout:-
    The HTML semantics refers to the tags that provide meaning to an HTML page rather than just presentation. It makes HTML more comprehensible by better defining the different sections and layout of web pages.
        
    The following HTML semantics tags can be used to break your page into identified parts:
        <header>: It defines a header for a web page.
        <nav>: It defines a container for navigation links.
        <section>: This defines a section in a web page.
        <article>: This element contains information about the web page.
        <aside>: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document.
        <footer>: It defines a footer for a document or a section.

-Text Formatting Tags:-
    HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning.
    Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:
        <b> - Bold text
        <strong> - Important text
        <i> - Italic text
        <em> - Emphasized text
        <mark> - Marked text
        <small> - Smaller text
        <del> - Deleted text
        <ins> - Inserted text
        <sub> - Subscript text
        <sup> - Superscript text

-Image, Video and Audio Tag:-
    >Audio Tag:
        The <audio> tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams.The <audio> tag contains one or more <source> tags with different audio sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports.The text between the <audio> and </audio> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.There are three supported audio formats in HTML: MP3, WAV, and OGG.

    >Video Tag:
        The <video> tag is used to embed video content in a document, such as a movie clip or other video streams.The <video> tag contains one or more <source> tags with different video sources. The browser will choose the first source it supports.The text between the <video> and </video> tags will only be displayed in browsers that do not support the <video> element.There are three supported video formats in HTML: MP4, WebM, and OGG.

    >Image Tag:
        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

        The <img> tag has two required attributes:
            src - Specifies the path to the image
            alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason   cannot be displayed

-Iframe Tag:-
    The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame.An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.

    
CONCLUSION:
We learnt to create a webpage using HTML elements like list tag, sementics tags, image, audio and video tag, text formatting tags and iframe tags.
