    <h1 class="heading">Types of Computer</h1>
    <h1 class="topic">1. Supercomputer</h1>
    <h2 class="c1">One of types of computers is supercomputer. It is a computer that is at the front-line of current processing capacity, particularly speed of calculation. It is usually used to do tasks involving intense numerical calculations such as weather forecasting, fluid dynamics, nuclear simulations, theoretical astrophysics, and complex scientific computations. </h1>

    <h1 class="topic">2. Mainframe Computer</h1>
    <h2 class="c2">Another computer type is mainframe computer. It is a computer that is capable of handling and processing very large amounts of data quickly. Its calculation speed can reach millions to tens of millions instructions per second (MIPS) and it can respond to hundreds of millions of users at a time.This computer type is mainly used in large institutions such as government, banks and large corporations.</h2>

    <h1 class="topic">3. Minicomputer (Mid-Range Computer)</h1>
    <h2 class="c3">Minicomputers are a class of multi-user computers that lie in the middle range of the computing spectrum, in between the smallest mainframe computers and the largest single-user systems (microcomputers or personal computers). Minicomputers are usually small in scale, simple in structure, easy to maintain, and low in cost. Therefore, they are often used in universities, scientific research institutions and industrial control fields.</h1>

    <h1 class="topic">4. Microcomputer (Personal Computer)</h1>
    <h2 class="c4">With the introduction of systems based on single chip microprocessors, the term "microcomputer" was coined. Microcomputers would have been prohibitively expensive for a single person to own in the early days. However, by the late twentieth century, microcomputers had become the most common type of computer. As a result, the term "microcomputer" has practically become obsolete and has been replaced by the term "personal computer (PC)." Because of its small size, ease of use, low production cost, and low price, the personal computer has grown rapidly. PC computing speed can reach hundreds of thousands to millions of instructions per second, meeting the demands of data processing and scientific computing in manufacturing, scientific research, and everyday life.</h1>

   <h1 class="topic">5. Server Computer</h1>
    <h2><i>A server refers to a high-performance computer that provides shared information resources and various services for many users on the network at the same time in a network environment.</i> A server is expected to be capable of high-speed computing, long-term reliable operation (it features error-correction of RAM; redundant cooling; self-monitoring, RAID), and powerful external data throughput. The structure of the server is similar to that of an ordinary computer. Many smaller servers are actually personal computers that have been dedicated to provide services for other computers. But they are very different in terms of processing power, stability, reliability, security, scalability, and manageability.</h2>

    <h1 class="topic">6. Workstation Computer</h1>
    <h2 class="c6">A workstation computer is a high-end personal computer between microcomputers and minicomputers. It is usually equipped with large-capacity memory, external storage, and large-screen displays. Therefore, it has strong data processing capabilities and graphics processing capabilities.
        Workstation computers are designed and developed mainly for professional application fields like engineering design, animation production, scientific research, software development, financial management, information services, analog simulation, etc.</h1>
